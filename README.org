#+TITLE: UglifyJS.rb -- a JavaScript parser/compressor/beautifier in Ruby

This is a Ruby port of the outstanding [[https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS][UglifyJS]] project by Mihai Bazon.
See that project on Github for full details.

The Ruby version of Uglify has several distinct advantages over the native JavaScript (Node) implementation:

- It is written in Ruby, which is great if you like that kind of thing.
- It is around 100x slower, leaving you time to make a cup of tea, coffee, or even go out to lunch.
- It is less well tested, giving you the chance to find and fix bugs yourself.
- It is not kept up to date, meaning there won't be any scary feature enhancements on the way.

The Ruby port has some testing scripts, which simply compare the output from minifying a few scripts with the node equivalent.
